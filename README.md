# Senior Project
Senior project at Lafayette, on machine learning, where I study the theory and build the tools.

## Setup
Time to build boys. The tools are in different repos. Just gather them.


## Notes and outlines

#### Main theme (remember this is math)
- Machine learning, general techniques, models etc.
- NELL architecture, theories and tweaked design. Top level KB, influencing low level algorithms/ML.
- NELL applied, to generic big data. Finance, because of abundant data. This often requires human intuition - translated into the alpha. Very complex and many interactions (unlike image recognition etc.) 
- Implementations (not necessarily complete). I'm building the tools.


#### Sections
- Introduction to machine learning
- Popular techniques, recent popularity in the industry.
- The old paradigm: singular and one-off.

- The new paradigm: NELL. Inspiration, problem solved, theory, features.
- Current status
- Pros and cons.


#### Theoretical side


#### Implementation side
