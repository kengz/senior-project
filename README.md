## Abstract
This paper gives a gentle introduction to artificial neural networks with focus on the mathematical foundation and industrial applications. We include the core concepts and algorithms, organized systematically and simplified with tensorial notations. Moreover, we build up the topics from the simpler, fundamental components, going from the perceptron artificial neural net, gradient descent, backpropagation, to autoencoders and deep neural net. The latest progresses in research and industrial applications are included as well. Finally, we briefly describe TensorFlow, and discuss the future of artificial intelligence.
